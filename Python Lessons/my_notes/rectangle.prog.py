#This app calculates the perimeter and area of a rectangle

# 1. get a value from user to define the height
height = int(input())

# 2. get a value from user to define the width
width = int(input())

# 3. calculate the area
area = height*width

# 4. what is the permiter
perimeter = (height+width)*2

# 5. Give the calculation to user
